Recently I've been researching some various home server type projects.

- https://umbrel.com
- https://www.home-assistant.io/
- https://yunohost.org/
- https://sandstorm.io/

I'm curious to see how they go about deploying "apps" and managing them.
Umbrel and Home Assistant use Docker while Yunohost and Sandstorm use other methods.
