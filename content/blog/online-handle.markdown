Through middle and high school I was in the Boy Scouts.
Each Boy Scout Troop is broken up into patrols of several boys.
Each patrol has a name, which was often something pretty generic when I was in scouts.
Common examples would be animals or creatures like fox patrol, bat patrol, dragon patrol, etc.
While sitting around a campfire one evening, a friend commented on how generic some of the names were.

> We should be the Kung Fu Disco Monkeys

For whatever reason, that name amused me greatly and I started using `KungFuDiscoMonkey` as my handle whenever playing online games.
Sometimes when it's too long, I would just abbreviate it as kfdm and use the abbreviated form for various logins.
This also means that sometimes I would get random `@mentions` since KFDM also happens to be a TV station in Texas.
