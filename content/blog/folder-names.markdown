title: What's in a (folder) name

Quite a long time ago (long enough ago I do not remember the original source) I read a blog post or poll about various folder names on the computer. I recently remembered it and thought about writing it down.

# Projects

I believe when I was in university, they had us using [Eclipse] as an IDE to write Java code. By default, Eclipse defaulted to a `~/Projects` folder, so for many years that has been my default directory for my own projects. When I moved to web development and PHP and then later into Python, I used other editors like TextMate or Atom but I kept using `~/Projects` for any of my coding projects.

# Source

At some point, I wanted to keep downloaded code that I was just using, separate from the code I was writing myself, so I started using a `~/Sources` directory in addition to store code I had downloaded to use in other places.

# References

After a while, I decided I wanted to break things out a bit more so I created a `~/References` directory for code I downloaded just to read (for example downloading Django or some of the Prometheus projects when I had a question). This was also influenced by the [alfred-repos] plugin since I often use that to open projects, and having the extra bit of distinction in the path helps know what folder I'm opening.

# Code

Many years ago I discovered [wakatime] which is a neat service to keep track of what you spend your time working on. For my local environment it's easy enough to point it at `~/Projects` but for work stuff, I was more wary of accidentally sending things to the cloud. I started using a `~/Code` directory on work computers so that open source work could be recorded by work only projects would not be.

# Default Directories

Since I have been primarily using MacOS for the past few years, I also use a few of the default directories. `~/Documents` is for random non coding projects, `~/Pictures` is for some misc photos and `~/Desktop` is mostly for anything temporary that hasn't been filed away.
