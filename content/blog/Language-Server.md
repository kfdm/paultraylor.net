Last year, I switched to [vscode] and as part of that, have become interested in how the [language server protocol] works. As part of my [worklog] project, I've been building various tools and scripts around [hugo] to manage my notes and day to day tasks, and building a language server to handle some of the formatting tasks may be an interesting way to implement some of the required functionality.
