Assorted interesting bits that helped get me to where I am today

## Web Framework - PHP/MySQL

Started in the later part of my senior year of High School, I wrote a PHP framework that I used to power older versions of my site.

## Murasaki

*2D Game Engine in C#*

Started after graduation from North Carolina State University, I wrote the beginnings of a 2D game engine in C# to become more familiar with the language and tools.

## Python library for TheHitList
Provides a python library to access [The Hit List](http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/) through appscript's python to apple script bridge.  Currently in its early stages.  Will eventually be used to provide a method of importing entries from task trackers such as Piviotal Tracker or dates from Google Calendar and convert them into tasks.
