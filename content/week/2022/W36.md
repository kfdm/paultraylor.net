I had not planned on spending most of my afternoon prototyping a [vscode-worklog] extension, but once I started writing, I kept tweaking _one more thing_ until most of my afternoon had disappeared. The code is still super messy and there are bugs I found while writing this post, but at least the basic prototype seems reasonable.

I also spent some of this morning working on upgrading some of my test virtual machines. I probably have a lot of old settings files to cleanup so that may be a longer term cleanup. I had wanted to upgrade to a newer distro so that I have access to a newer system python.

In Final Fantasy XIV I managed to get my [island sanctuary] up to level 10 so now I can fly around and I also managed to have enough saved for the bike mount.

On Saturday, my gaming group finished [Raft] so I think we'll spend the next few weeks on some of the seasonal stuff in [Deep Rock Galactic].

There is more I would like to try to write about (instead of just weekly summary posts) but one of my cats seems to _really_ demand attention in the evening, which limits the amount of extra time I have to draft something. Hopefully I can find a good balance soon. I don't recall my families cats being _quite_ so demanding when I was younger.
