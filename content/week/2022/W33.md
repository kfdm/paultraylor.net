summary: Surprise long weekend
---

I did not realize until Wednesday, that there was a holiday on Thursday ([山の日]) so then I quickly took Friday off as well to make it a LONG weekend.

I spent a bit more time than I intended on [FFXIV] but I finished leveling [monk], [summoner], and [scholar] to 90 and finished the role quests. I may spend some time working on [machinist] and [dancer] to fill out some DPS classes.

Reading up on [owntracks] adding support to share location via their [tour] functionatlity inspired me to spend some time cleaning up my [django-owntracks] module. Ended up spending a decent amount of time trying out [leaflet] to render a map.

I've also been enjoying reading [Dr.Stone](https://manga.line.me/book/detail?id=002ir05q)

Going to try to write week notes again to help me build up some momentum to post a bit more.
