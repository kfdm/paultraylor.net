# Not taking things Personally

<https://medium.dave-bailey.com/the-art-of-not-taking-things-personally-b7a8395ce172>

> When we encounter emotions and behaviours that don’t make sense to us, it’s often because we don’t have all the information. And in the absence of information, we tend to assume the worst.

The past few days, I've had to deal with a somewhat sudden issue that has me a bit miffed. It's quite surprising timing to have this come up in my feed. I think I also need to be more mindful of my own stress bucket at times. My local [cat cafe](https://www.neko-cota.com/index_top.html) is sometime a good way to help melt some stress away. Now that the weather is finally starting to cool down a bit, evening walks are another of my favorite ways to reduce stress.

# Finished current volumes of 不滅のあなたへ (~16 巻)

I finished reading all the released volumes of [不滅のあなたへ](https://manga.line.me/book/product_list?product_id=00008sp8) so far. It's a rather pecuilier series so far. While I enjoyed some of the settings and world building through volume 9, I feel like things started getting rather complicated after that. The time skip in Volume 13 and some of the recent volumes have also been a bit all over the place, so its harder to see where the story is ultimately heading. Though I'm still curious to see what the next volume holds in store.

# a capella metal ?

Sometimes Spotify gives somewhat random recommendations (I don't speak German nor Russian) but this has been a neat recommendation the past week. I've particularly enjoyed [Faith Focus Finish](https://open.spotify.com/track/3StzT4cfSbdiDE3BCRhp3x?si=251fd6625d2e4035) and their take on [Fear of the Dark](https://open.spotify.com/track/0dKtXWDvxOkxFjstDgQZmB?si=6b7874d0809c4484)
