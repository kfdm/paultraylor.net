Monday was [mountain day] so it was a shorter work week. Though most of this week the weather in Kyushu was full of heavy rain, leaving me a bit less energetic than usual. I'm trying to take more daily notes in [noteplan] to help me remember what I did for the week.

# Review Season

Next week start our twice-yearly review season at work. This time it's a bit delayed due to syncing up with some parent company restructuring, so our review period is from November 2020 until now. To review the past term, I typically look through my Jira and Github (Enterprise and Public) tickets, and try to see how well my output matched what I thought I would accomplish for the term. If I was writing the report in confluence, then I could probably more easily embed some Jira queries, but I don't really enjoy the confluence wiki syntax. I currently document most of my work using Hugo, though that means I do not have a good way of adding in Jira queries. I would love to have some kind of component I could add for this. I've been experimenting a bit with [htmx] and [vuejs] though it's highly unlikely that I'll have something ready by next week.

# iPadOS 15 Beta

I installed the Beta version on my iPad because I wanted to be able to use some of the new SwiftUI features while testing. `Pull to Refresh` and `swipeActions` are two of the things that had been on my SwiftUI wishlist, and they should help me build some small apps in the design I had imagined. For now, I'm making an small, focused grocery/chore app called [redo] to experiment with some of the new SwiftUI changes. I still continue to have a lot of trouble using SwiftUI preview views and end up doing most of my testing on my device.

# Media

- I finished Higurashi [gou] and started [sotsu] which I've now caught up with. I'm enjoying the series so far, but parts of the series have been even more violent and shocking than previous iterations which I could probably have done without. The absolute cruelty of one of the characters has also been a bit surprising, and it's curious how they will try to redeam them by the end of the series.
- [District 9] was one of the recommendations from the algorithms recently and decided to rewatch it this week.
- [The Truman Show] was another watch this week. I had not seen the movie before, though I had seen various clips on youtube in the past. Being a bit lethargic due to the rainy weather, I thought this would be a good way to pass some time. I quite enjoyed the movie.
