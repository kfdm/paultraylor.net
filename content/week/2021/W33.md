I've been continuing to try to cut most social media down and removing sources of "doom scrolling" to see if I can help reset some of my mood and restore my focus.

# Mixing Python and Go

For [promgen] there are numerous places where I would like to be able to reuse bits of Prometheus to help in some syntax checks and such. The biggest problem is that Promgen is writtne in Python (using Django) and Prometheus is written in Go. On Friday, I was able to find [setuptools-golang] which looks like it can help with writing a Go library that can then be accessed via Python. The biggest challenge is going to be converting between Python types and Go types via C.

# Watching

- Watched [Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World:_Fallen_Kingdom) on Saturday. The series is getting a bit silly at this point.

# Reading

- The idea of having a [/now](https://nownownow.com/about) page is kinda neat.
- Thoughts on getting into [flow](https://sharif.io/flow/)
- Neat diagram showing different [cognitive bias](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg)
