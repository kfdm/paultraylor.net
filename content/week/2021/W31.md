In order to force myself to get in the habit of documenting more of my work, I want to try to start writing weekly notes of what I have been up to.

# Django Static Site

I've been prototyping an idea to have a Django plugin for processing a static site to add into the tree. At a high level it should work like [flatpage] though read from the disk instead of database for pages.

# Widgets

I've been working on creating a [widget] for my [todo] app, to show the tasks for today.

Widgets do not support [List] so I'm having to manually make a List out of a VStack. If I use a basic font modifier like `.font(.Title)` then things are way too large, so I'm struggling a bit trying to get everything sized correctly.

# LTSV to fluent-bit

Recently I've been using [ltsv] as a custom log format for Nginx and I spent some time this weekend trying to get it piped through fluent-bit properly.

# Beat Saber

Been enjoying picking up [Beat Saber] again, working through some of the original soundtrack trying to play more songs on Expert, though there are a few songs that I can only complete on Hard.
