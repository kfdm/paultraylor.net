> I wish very badly that Linux had a culture of shareware and small indie devs like Mac does. An obsessive commitment to everything being F(L)OSS does not necessarily result in good software.

Both [Part 1](https://anelki.net/post/2023/02/linux/) and [Part 2](https://anelki.net/post/2023/02/linux-2/) spoke to me. I try to be fairly careful when I say "I prefer _foo_ for reasons X and Y" but it never seems to stop being annoying when people try to declare that "_bar_ is better and _foo_ sucks" for whatever reason. I often joke that often people aren't arguing on **technical** reasons, but instead hold deeply **religious** beliefs for their choice in tech. If they were arguing purely on **technical** reasons then they wouldn't be trying to convert me to their **religion** now would they . . .

I do expect at some point I'll spend more time migrating away from the Apple ecosystem since there are quite a few things I prefer in a Linux environment.
