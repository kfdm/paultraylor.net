> An open-source, manual pick-and-place machine for PCB artisans

With the increased interest in Mastodon and the Fediverse, I have been enjoying following various tags like [projects], [esphome], and [esp32]. I've also been watching more maker videos on Youtube. Recently watching videos like [Why Robots Build Every Piece of Electronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3hKPOlG934) which shows off some of the hardware used to build electronics at SparkFun or [How PCB is Made in China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GVk_hEMjzs).

While I still have almost no idea what I'm doing when it comes to hardware, following these tags and finding tools like Pixel Pump lets me imagine what it would be like if I get to the point where I could make my own PCBs and hardware devices.
