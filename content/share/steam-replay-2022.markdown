It's interesting and kinda fun to see more year replay type posts.
I think [Spotify Wrapped] is the one that that I usually remember as the first one to start doing this.
[Gyroscope] also does a very nice one built from various data points over the year.

Most of what shows up on my Steam Replay is from games I played with my weekly gaming group.
I've been continuing to play Final Fantasy XIV most days but I play that outside of steam.
Otherwise I'm sure it would have dominated my numbers more.
